Once you have dedicated enough time to each syllable, of each line, to ensure that punchline works everytime you use that bit, then the material is unstoppable. Unstoppable material gives you confidence on stage. Its why so much material is stolen by other acts. They see a bit kill, they know it works, they take it and they kill too.

Comedians tend to call themselves comedians or comics. I agree with with Joe in that it isnt a conversation, its a presentation, however, you raise a good point in that there is an exchange between performer and audience.

This is why its important to keep written accounts of all your thoughts and half worked jokes, because at some point in the future, that idle imagining could be the spark your 'future you' needs to complete a new bit. Also, as heartbreaking as it is, every perfect joke you write - has a lifespan. You can only say it so many times before you get bored saying it. When you feel that malaise sinking in to your shows, you know its time to retire the old material, the comedy gold you've wrought from the ether of your own imagination, you simply put it away and try writing new jokes that work just as well or better. Lewis Black retires his routine EVERY year. Furthermore, his big finishing joke, the closer to end his routine, becomes his opening gag for the new year. This then forces him to write material that is at least as good as his previous years closer - or better.

But the longer you do comedy, the more the question \"I am okay with this kind of material being my legacy?\"  \"Did I push the art itself to a new level?\"","channel_id":"877612915333681233","author":{"id":"215162686801969152","username":"WillMcfly","avatar":"85d88c3a07b4b0f2048cae54438d6544","avatar_decoration":null,"discriminator":"0001","public_flags":258},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"timestamp":"2021-08-23T13:16:37.766000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2021-08-23T13:27:26.957000+00:00","flags":0,"components":[]},{"id":"879354056563368056","type":0,"content":"But its also a subjective thing and depends on the comedians motivation.","channel_id":"877612915333681233","author":{"id":"215162686801969152","username":"WillMcfly","avatar":"85d88c3a07b4b0f2048cae54438d6544","avatar_decoration":null,"discriminator":"0001","public_flags":258},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"timestamp":"2021-08-23T13:19:04.693000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[]},{"id":"879354824645304360","type":19,"content":"**Furthermore, his big finishing joke, the closer to end his routine, becomes his opening gag for the new year.

This is why its important to keep written accounts of all your thoughts and half worked jokes, because at some point in the future, that idle imagining could be the spark your 'future you' needs to complete a new bit. Also, as heartbreaking as it is, every perfect joke you write - has a lifespan. You can only say it so many times before you get bored saying it. When you feel that malaise sinking in to your shows, you know its time to retire the old material, the comedy gold you've wrought from the ether of your own imagination, you simply put it away and try writing new jokes that work just as well or better.

Nolan, start by writing your own original jokes. Best bet is to tell stories from your own life about the experiences youve had that made you laugh. Once you have roughly 5-7 minutes of stories (you hope are funny) sign up at a local open mike night and perform them in front of an audience. Record your performance so you can see  what the audience laughed at and what they didn't laugh at. Rewrite the bits that didnt work and have another go at the open mic. You can also post your material in one of the text channels here, and we can assist in rewriting and editing the material with you.

You definitely dont need to ever put into your joke a line about how you think something is funny, after all, its a comedy show, if you didnt think it was funny - you wouldnt have said it? There isn't a clear connection between 'Pubic' health and conjunctivitus which means you need a stronger segueway between the two 'bits' so that it follows a natural progression.

Best bet is to tell stories from your own life about the experiences youve had that made you laugh. Once you have roughly 5-7 minutes of stories (you hope are funny) sign up at a local open mike night and perform them in front of an audience. Record your performance so you can see  what the audience laughed at and what they didn't laugh at. Rewrite the bits that didnt work and have another go at the open mic. You can also post your material in one of the text channels here, and we can assist in rewriting and editing the material with you.

So you should look at people like Bily Connoly, Norm MacDonald, Bill Burr and Eddie Izzard for starters. Bill Hicks did quite a bit of observational long form too. Depends if youre a political beast at heart as to enjoyment. Essentially, anecdotal humour is based on stories from your life, what youve observed, how it made you feel, what you learned about the world you live in or yourself and how that new knowledge has changed you. Billy Connoly tells 'shaggy dog stories' from his own life and experiences mixed with puns and dad jokes, Norm tells bad jokes, really well. Bill Burr extrapolates on hypotheses he's manufactured about the reality of the world he lives in and how it differs from what people display as truth. Eddie Izzard recreates scenes from history utilising character development, vocal techniques and exaggeration.

is a magical place, and a terrible one at most, but for the sake of this bit I will rant about how school is THE WORST PLACE TO BE IN. For starters, when I entered high school this year, I never expected there to be so much bullying and gossiping, but it turns out I was wrong, especially when most of it came from the teachers. Then there’s the lunch, I don’t wanna be another guy that rants about how bad school lunch is but by god how do you come up with such VILE, MONSTROSITY of lunches in the span of 3 FUCKIN HOURS. Then there’s the quiet kid… The quiet kid, oh god do I have to spill it out, every time I’m next to this kid I feel like I’m the first one to get killed by a Colt 1851 Navy Revolver that he got out of his step-dad’s closet. But the thing that makes me angry, THE THING THAT MAKES ME MAD. THE TOILET PAPER!!! Like how am I supposed to wipe my ass with sandpaper, tearing through parts of my anus, while I'm just sitting there with crocodile tears rolling down my face in deep, desperate pain, hoping that at the end of the day, I can go to the hospital to get it surgically fixed. ANOTHER THING that bothers me the most about school.. Is the amount of studying that went from 8th to 9th in a single year. How am I supposed to finish a whole 200 page thesis about why your cock is 6 inches relevant to the amount of gravity pushing it back, when last year I was assigned to read a 30 page book that was about how to keep your hands to yourself!?! I don’t know if there is a good thing about school, I DON'T KNOW IF I’LL EVER STOP..

Then a booker sees your performance, comes up to you after the gig and says something along the lines of 'That was the best 10 minutes Ive ever seen, you have to perform at my club - here's $100!'. Unfortunately, this is a fairytale. If you want gigs, you HAVE to hustle. Bookers don't know you, so you have to sell yourself as a better fit for their gig than the people they do know. Call bookers EVERYDAY and ask for a spot. Eventually they'll book you just to shut you up, but it will also let them know that youre serious about doing this.

Look for verbs in the premisse and punchline. These are 'doing' words. Doing words can be accompanied by an action. There is an old acting addage that the word mimcs the action and the action mimics the word, so when you find a verb, find an action to visually reinforce the action. To make a joke out of the verb/action interplay, make the verb incongruous or the opposite of the word. Experiment with the material and the actions to see which works best. Facial expressions are all about committment and incongruity. Smiling broadly while saying 'My Grandma just died...' is incongruous with the information the audience has just received and provides subtext to the story youre telling. Why are you smiling? You must be pleased she's dead! Why are you pleased grandma is dead? Usually people love their grandma.... yours must have left you money or possibly she was mean and life is better without her in it. All this... from smiling while saying 'Grandmas dead'. Try different facial expressions with different premises for your jokes, happy, sad, embarrased, shy, psychotic, angry. You'll be surprised just what kind of range you can develop with your material just by providing a small amount of subtext with a simple facial expression. You dont have to 'write' facial expressions in to your jokes - you'll know what face to make when youve selected the one that gets the biggest laugh.","channel_id":"877612915333681233","author":{"id":"331232519737442305","username":"m3dik8","avatar":"9e69c6afc51bdaefe4dd9547251e977d","avatar_decoration":null,"discriminator":"7625","public_flags":0},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"mentions":[{"id":"878472751315300393","username":"Dashdar","avatar":"400e109cd56930044accced78f355e2d","avatar_decoration":null,"discriminator":"5826","public_flags":0}],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"timestamp":"2021-09-18T02:10:27.072000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[],"message_reference":{"channel_id":"877612915333681233","guild_id":"514967871823020053","message_id":"888499538652987433"},"referenced_message":{"id":"888499538652987433","type":0,"content":"Because to me it's not just the words it the expressions you make on your face the tone of voice the pitch all that and my dumbii thicc brain can't seem tk comprehensive how to do that on paper","channel_id":"877612915333681233","author":{"id":"878472751315300393","username":"Dashdar","avatar":"400e109cd56930044accced78f355e2d","avatar_decoration":null,"discriminator":"5826","public_flags":0},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"timestamp":"2021-09-17T18:59:57.538000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[]}},{"id":"888901235128823838","type":0,"content":"i always wondered?

Back then, those acts werent competing against each other, they were all stars in their own right.

So the insults became deeper and more cutting. Often times you can see the roastee getting very uncomfortable. Even the acts took huge risks. Gilbert Gottfried suffered a media and bookings backlash after his joke about being late for the roast as he had to catch a connecting flight at the empire state building. 9/11 was still fresh in the mind of the audience.

So I was pretty sure I was not going to be smarter than him but I still have three more siblings so I just told myself not to stress it. So, my next sibling is my sister, Morgan, and she became a Fashion Designer, and I was like I might be able to do that so I got a sewing machine and tried it and I learned two things important; One sewing is a lot harder than it looks and Two, that the sewing needle is supposed to be sewing the clothes, not your thumb. so I decided that I still had two siblings left and just like before I decided not to stress it so the next one is my brother (Brady) now Brady loves math and he becomes an Actuary and I had no idea what 'an Actuary' is and later I found out the reason I had no idea what an Actuary is, because to become an Actuary you have to become some sort of super genius (I still don't know what an Actuary is). So I was like there is still one more brother and he's super weird I am confident that I can be better than him, now before I say anything more I want you to know something about him, he is weird, for example, on Easter he went on the roof of his house with his black cloak (my sister Morgan made him a cloak with a hood and it is dark gray sort of blackish color) did an evil laugh and then yelled out \" HE HAS RISEN\" and then did another evil laugh. By the way that is not even the weirdest thing he did. So I was like there is no way he is going to be better than me... I just learned that he is discerning becoming a priest, so I just said that is it I give up, I will just become a comedian. ​​​","channel_id":"877612915333681233","author":{"id":"878999241228439563","username":"kaitlan","avatar":null,"avatar_decoration":null,"discriminator":"1777","public_flags":0},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"timestamp":"2021-10-15T19:03:49.555000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[]},{"id":"899510750903685160","type":0,"content":"so im thinking of this joke, but it doesnt seem that funny, cuz i know it has potential to be better","channel_id":"877612915333681233","author":{"id":"764070831524675605","username":"jayjayy","avatar":"5ef5807d0292b39adbc3a7ce52b06759","avatar_decoration":null,"discriminator":"4082","public_flags":0},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"timestamp":"2021-10-18T04:14:35.117000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[]},{"id":"899510846538010644","type":0,"content":"so if you could just tell me how much it sucks, that would be awesome :))","channel_id":"877612915333681233","author":{"id":"764070831524675605","username":"jayjayy","avatar":"5ef5807d0292b39adbc3a7ce52b06759","avatar_decoration":null,"discriminator":"4082","public_flags":0},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"timestamp":"2021-10-18T04:14:57.918000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[]},{"id":"899510859779440672","type":0,"content":"zoom shows me when im talking and muted, i say, show me notifications when im talking and unmuted, like constantly message me to make sure i wanna be unmuted, send messages like, \"bitch currently everyone here in the zoom meeting can hear you, would you like to either shut the fuck up or have me mute you so that people dont have to tear out their ears after hearing you screech like that\"","channel_id":"877612915333681233","author":{"id":"764070831524675605","username":"jayjayy","avatar":"5ef5807d0292b39adbc3a7ce52b06759","avatar_decoration":null,"discriminator":"4082","public_flags":0},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"timestamp":"2021-10-18T04:15:01.075000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[]},{"id":"899543593851715584","type":19,"content":"Okay, so I like the concept. Instead of phrasing it as a wish, I might present it as a product. An app that says it maybe, because it seems funnier to me to have a robot call you a bitch. I also think that shortening it will help you massively. On average, a comedian is aiming for 4 laughs a minute, although that is a flexible rule. If you can't find a way to shorten it, I would add more jokes or absurd images in the setup so that it seems shorter or at least more entertaining. The screeching noise is practical, yes, but I think you could further push it into the absurd to increase the hilarity of the image. I like the relatability of your concept and I think it will connect with an audience, but I wonder if you could create double meaning somewhere in your setup. The funniest jokes force the audience to make an assumption and then subvert it, your joke relies on the subversion of the norm rather than anything you've set up.

Another way to do this is to find words that already have double meanings, like \"bark\" which could be a dog bark or tree bark, and play off that.","channel_id":"877612915333681233","author":{"id":"697679072586760195","username":"Irony is killing me","avatar":"e5b0b6d5c09c23229b4f4a7aa745758f","avatar_decoration":null,"discriminator":"1141","public_flags":0},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"mentions":[{"id":"764070831524675605","username":"jayjayy","avatar":"5ef5807d0292b39adbc3a7ce52b06759","avatar_decoration":null,"discriminator":"4082","public_flags":0}],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"timestamp":"2021-10-18T06:32:20.219000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[],"message_reference":{"channel_id":"877612915333681233","guild_id":"514967871823020053","message_id":"899544194392158258"}}},{"id":"899545951713234954","type":19,"content":"Exactly.","channel_id":"877612915333681233","author":{"id":"697679072586760195","username":"Irony is killing me","avatar":"e5b0b6d5c09c23229b4f4a7aa745758f","avatar_decoration":null,"discriminator":"1141","public_flags":0},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"mentions":[{"id":"764070831524675605","username":"jayjayy","avatar":"5ef5807d0292b39adbc3a7ce52b06759","avatar_decoration":null,"discriminator":"4082","public_flags":0}],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"timestamp":"2021-10-18T06:34:27.644000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[],"message_reference":{"channel_id":"877612915333681233","guild_id":"514967871823020053","message_id":"899545856892600361"},"referenced_message":{"id":"899545856892600361","type":19,"content":"ohoh or i could use common phrases, or at least like using rhyming and stuff, like i saw this reel with someone saying \" i am rich i am (something something) sick, and i have a huge... house","channel_id":"877612915333681233","author":{"id":"764070831524675605","username":"jayjayy","avatar":"5ef5807d0292b39adbc3a7ce52b06759","avatar_decoration":null,"discriminator":"4082","public_flags":0},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"mentions":[{"id":"697679072586760195","username":"Irony is killing me","avatar":"e5b0b6d5c09c23229b4f4a7aa745758f","avatar_decoration":null,"discriminator":"1141","public_flags":0}],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"timestamp":"2021-10-18T06:34:05.037000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[],"message_reference":{"channel_id":"877612915333681233","guild_id":"514967871823020053","message_id":"899545417254064148"}}},{"id":"899545997510868993","type":0,"content":"tysmmm, that was extremely useful","channel_id":"877612915333681233","author":{"id":"764070831524675605","username":"jayjayy","avatar":"5ef5807d0292b39adbc3a7ce52b06759","avatar_decoration":null,"discriminator":"4082","public_flags":0},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"timestamp":"2021-10-18T06:34:38.563000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[]},{"id":"899546062002479105","type":0,"content":"I'm glad, you're welcome.","channel_id":"877612915333681233","author":{"id":"697679072586760195","username":"Irony is killing me","avatar":"e5b0b6d5c09c23229b4f4a7aa745758f","avatar_decoration":null,"discriminator":"1141","public_flags":0},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"timestamp":"2021-10-18T06:34:53.939000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[]},{"id":"899546064615534614","type":0,"content":"and i really appreciate the detailed answer and suggestions","channel_id":"877612915333681233","author":{"id":"764070831524675605","username":"jayjayy","avatar":"5ef5807d0292b39adbc3a7ce52b06759","avatar_decoration":null,"discriminator":"4082","public_flags":0},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"timestamp":"2021-10-18T06:34:54.562000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[]},{"id":"899546077403947008","type":0,"content":":))","channel_id":"877612915333681233","author":{"id":"764070831524675605","username":"jayjayy","avatar":"5ef5807d0292b39adbc3a7ce52b06759","avatar_decoration":null,"discriminator":"4082","public_flags":0},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"timestamp":"2021-10-18T06:34:57.611000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[]},{"id":"899546249886330890","type":0,"content":"I just wanted to help.

is correct about it being too long, but incorrect about about adding profanities. You only need to add profanities when you really REALLY mean it. Otherwise the words lose their power if youre sprinkling them throughout your routines like rice at a wedding. Instead, consider trimming it down to its most basic elements, as <@!299782306216804352> has suggested. eg. ```At my last show I recently introduced myself as Latino and this woman in the audience says 'You mean Latin-x...

'Improv' is a funny stories with an established frame work where elements of the story have been provided by the audience. If you look at the story of Little Red Riding Hood, adding a character trait such as Nympho-klepto-mania (steals anything that could be a sex toy) to the lead character, the occupation of the woodsman to an Accountant and an animal to replace the big bad wolf, like a giraffe; makes for an interesting take on the classic story. The framework of the story is there, only particular elements have been changed to provide a new twists in the story. So when you improv, try picking someone in the crowd and deciding you were best friends at school. EG. ```You.... whats your name?``` ```David``` ```No... its Stacey... Stacey and I were best friends at school werent we Stacy?``` ```My name is David?``` ```Hahaha... yes Stacy I remember you were always pretending to be someone else...``` Make up INSANE stories about the things you used to get up to at school before she went into witness relocation and changed her gender to avoid the Mob hitsquad after her. Everytime you ask for confirmation of the story and if they confirm or deny it, just say 'Yes it did happen Stacey...' and that provides your framework for the improvised bit and everytime you repeat that line, the audience will recognise it as a punchline.","channel_id":"877612915333681233","author":{"id":"331232519737442305","username":"m3dik8","avatar":"9e69c6afc51bdaefe4dd9547251e977d","avatar_decoration":null,"discriminator":"7625","public_flags":0},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"mentions":[{"id":"731133695913623602","username":"girpS_yxemS","avatar":"f36099828e8da0f897f952f973825a88","avatar_decoration":null,"discriminator":"3362","public_flags":0}],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"timestamp":"2021-12-05T00:28:11.061000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2021-12-05T00:35:57.587000+00:00","flags":0,"components":[],"message_reference":{"channel_id":"877612915333681233","guild_id":"514967871823020053","message_id":"916725763758227466"},"referenced_message":{"id":"916725763758227466","type":0,"content":"I want to get better at improv and so far I've just been doing trial and error to get better but  I don't think that's that smart looking back... 😅 , Can anyone give me any pointers/ advice?

To find your voice generally takes around 7-10 years. The ONLY way to get there is to stand in front of the audience, without ego or pretense and risk telling them your deepest innermost thoughts and truths and then be ok with them not liking you as human being because of what youve just said.

It has to be more than just both have 7 days, were you in a hurry setting your DVR before going away camping for a week?

I wouldn't sweat bombing to much though because everyone bombs. As I like to say, maybe only 10% of what I write is actually funny, but if I write a lot, then that 10% of a very big number is still a big number indeed. \n\nI wouldn't be afraid to rewrite a joke several times. As Andre says, this is *your* stand-up. *You* have to be the one to write and sell the joke. Which means ultimately your work should reflect what you know. Though there's a lot of this field that comes with time. \n\nAs for what I like in a setup/punchline routine (not that others like this) is the idea of expectation versus reality. The idea that to get the audience to laugh, you setup their expectations to be subverted by a reality unexpected. Another point about the relationship between setup and punchline that should be visited is the economy of words. Generally, one should try to use as few words as possible to make the joke. That's part of rewriting a joke too. Figuring out which words you don't need to make the same point. \n\nI don't think I've seen you post to much yet. There's <#841887514573799444> and <#841887596925943808> which I find are great for filtering ideas and getting feedback, never mind this channel. An exercise that I've found that works well is to write three to five jokes a day, if you can help it. They don't even have to be good ones. Comedy is a muscle and to build that muscle you have to exercise it.

Think about it like this. If something was funny enough to you, that you took the time to write it down, figure out how you wanted to tell it to the audience, then there had to have been 'something' in the bit that made you laugh. If you tell the joke to an audience and they don't laugh, its because you have not yet found a way to explain to the audience why its funny. That's why you tell the joke multiple times in front of multiple audiences, that's why you tweak and refine the joke constantly until you strike upon a formula of explaining the situation so succinctly, 99% of people in 99% of the audiences you perform for, laugh their tits off. Being a comedian is not just being \"funny\", it's communicating to the audience what you thought was funny, so they can understand what was funny too. The best comedians, are the ones who can pluck an audience out of their own heads and show them the world through the comedians eyes. They do this by making their stories auditorily rich with vocal techniques & sound effects that punctuate their points. They use body language and physical expression to convey what's happening in that moment in order to create something visually visceral and compelling. Every word is chosen specifically to take the audience member on a journey from the beginning of the joke, directly as possible, to the end with as few delays as required. If you want success in this field, you need to utilise EVERY communication tool available for best effect. Standing up in front of a room full of strangers and just speaking words into a microphone, is only 1% of the job.","channel_id":"877612915333681233","author":{"id":"331232519737442305","username":"m3dik8","avatar":"9e69c6afc51bdaefe4dd9547251e977d","avatar_decoration":null,"discriminator":"7625","public_flags":0},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":true,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"timestamp":"2022-02-27T21:46:47.154000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[],"reactions":[{"emoji":{"id":null,"name":"❤️"},"count":1,"me":false}]},{"id":"947614896646922260","type":19,"content":"What you should be talking about (to your parents) is how hard it is to make them laugh.

If she kills or bombs a gig, 11am the next day she has to stop thinking about it.Because if you kill and celebrate it too long you are not productive on your comedy anymore and if you bomb and cry about it too long u waste time not writing new jokes.I try to impliment it right now, like today I had a very great time, but I try to remember myself there is still so much work to do.\n\n\nDid any shit what i wrote here help a little bit? <:patrice:813126312507211796>","channel_id":"877612915333681233","author":{"id":"215162686801969152","username":"WillMcfly","avatar":"85d88c3a07b4b0f2048cae54438d6544","avatar_decoration":null,"discriminator":"0001","public_flags":258},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"mentions":[{"id":"693148188919464037","username":"Ross","avatar":"440681e1be48b0189d7f6ec3ab7c8871","avatar_decoration":null,"discriminator":"3320","public_flags":0}],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"timestamp":"2022-05-03T22:38:03.106000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[],"reactions":[{"emoji":{"id":null,"name":"❤️"},"count":2,"me":false}]},{"id":"971179618721738802","type":0,"content":"Definitely!

It just depends on how much work you're willing to put into it.","channel_id":"877612915333681233","author":{"id":"145369965283770368","username":"jessienebulous","avatar":"629108ad1b866b0e206e16e2ac55d542","avatar_decoration":null,"discriminator":"0985","public_flags":0},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"mentions":[{"id":"444390725342461952","username":"LexaproLocksmith","avatar":"04efd7ced3849079fa61446dc8797e19","avatar_decoration":null,"discriminator":"8429","public_flags":0}],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"timestamp":"2022-07-28T03:23:01.819000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[]},{"id":"1002786657470271518","type":0,"content":"I think that is all really good advice","channel_id":"877612915333681233","author":{"id":"990021086752170006","username":"Luke Willoughby","avatar":null,"avatar_decoration":null,"discriminator":"9411","public_flags":0},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"timestamp":"2022-07-30T03:56:10.016000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[]},{"id":"1002786727569666098","type":0,"content":"I would only disagree, that if you do quit then it wasn't for you because you weren't into it enough to keep going","channel_id":"877612915333681233","author":{"id":"990021086752170006","username":"Luke Willoughby","avatar":null,"avatar_decoration":null,"discriminator":"9411","public_flags":0},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"timestamp":"2022-07-30T03:56:26.729000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2022-07-30T03:57:55.720000+00:00","flags":0,"components":[]},{"id":"1003849000304254976","type":0,"content":"Any tips on keeping your spirits high at depressing open mics hearing the same people everywhere","channel_id":"877612915333681233","author":{"id":"371731658669424640","username":"k0nstrukt","avatar":"f5c2ee0a8924841a034990647dd35daf","avatar_decoration":null,"discriminator":"0909","public_flags":0},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"timestamp":"2022-08-02T02:17:32.285000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[]},{"id":"1003849801126916097","type":0,"content":"Oof good question lol","channel_id":"877612915333681233","author":{"id":"678684108041486347","username":"booperdooper","avatar":"a931dca0067818eae7583b54b3b3bd01","avatar_decoration":null,"discriminator":"6919","public_flags":0},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"timestamp":"2022-08-02T02:20:43.216000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[]},{"id":"1003850224869064774","type":0,"content":"Hmm, if you’re performing then it’s hard to comment on hearing the same shit without sounding like an asshole","channel_id":"877612915333681233","author":{"id":"678684108041486347","username":"booperdooper","avatar":"a931dca0067818eae7583b54b3b3bd01","avatar_decoration":null,"discriminator":"6919","public_flags":0},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"timestamp":"2022-08-02T02:22:24.244000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[]},{"id":"1003850959883096064","type":0,"content":"I’ve found a moment or two to bring the laughs back up when others are bombing or just doing the same shit over and over, but it’s a hard line to be on.

I was 1 of 13 contestants, the only woman, and of course the only one in a wheelchair in the whole building. Which added to my nervousness. But I was also very excited. I had 1 drink, but only 1 because I wanted a clear head. I went on, and had the thought \"I'm not sure I can do this\" but once I started doing my act, and got that first laugh from the audience, my nerves melted away. I'd practiced my act enough that it felt second nature, and the laughs felt great. I got huge applause at the end, and it felt wonderful. Later on when they announced I'd qualified for the finals, I was VERY surprised but thrilled (no, I didn't end up winning, but I was satisfied with how far I did get). \n\nMy advice is to practice, practice, practice. I think people make the mistake of devoting the majority of their time to writing their act, which is of course incredibly important, but then they practice it out loud twice and call it good. I practiced multiple times a day, for I think 2 weeks before the competition. Now, I have a neurological condition that affects my memory, so part the reason I practiced so much is because I HAD to, just to memorize it. But I think it helped in other ways. I practiced with pauses in my act for laughter breaks, so that I would be used to that timing. I recorded myself doing my act and played it back over and over. It may sound silly, but I even practiced using a hairbrush as a microphone, so I got used to holding it the correct distance from my face, so that didn't throw me off. 🤣 In the end, I think all the practice was absolutely worth it, and I recommend devoting plenty of practice time before you get up there on stage.","channel_id":"877612915333681233","author":{"id":"145369965283770368","username":"jessienebulous","avatar":"629108ad1b866b0e206e16e2ac55d542","avatar_decoration":null,"discriminator":"0985","public_flags":0},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"mentions":[{"id":"334499758070693912","username":"Juan C.

Going theater/comedy route is a grind for most people. Loads of comedians and theater types live the paycheck to paycheck, no health insurance life of hand to mouth and try to make their art work. My own personal opinion is that if I'm stressed my art is gonna be shit and not worth producing anyway. After years of job to job I ended up working in an industry I can retire in, which gives me enough money to continue my art/comedy unstressed. The trick is you can't ever stop working on your art, but the job has to support the art at least until you can make that leap into the art supporting itself. \nThen again, people younger than you make thousands of dollars a month off youtube channels, so it's not like you couldn't find a way to support your art like that. But on the other hand, as a lawyer who does comedy and theater, you'd have a big knowledge leap over others (can focus in entertainment law) and be able to do specialized comedy bits and writing about it. Whatever you do you should be happy doing it. If law doesn't make you happy don't do it, but if you can go to school for law and then have a showbusiness career at least you've got something to fall back on if you ever get cancelled.","channel_id":"877612915333681233","author":{"id":"751713271282925621","username":"lestrange1","avatar":"9ab4fa90f1137c6a21e35730b492ed5b","avatar_decoration":null,"discriminator":"1631","public_flags":0},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"mentions":[{"id":"922168611236372580","username":"MissDimi","avatar":"a84c06a507024dcf7f8ab87014426c14","avatar_decoration":null,"discriminator":"6110","public_flags":0}],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"timestamp":"2022-08-13T02:22:11.050000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[],"message_reference":{"channel_id":"877612915333681233","guild_id":"514967871823020053","message_id":"1007831556192206940"},"referenced_message":{"id":"1007831556192206940","type":0,"content":"Hii!

That's my motto.","channel_id":"877612915333681233","author":{"id":"145369965283770368","username":"jessienebulous","avatar":"629108ad1b866b0e206e16e2ac55d542","avatar_decoration":null,"discriminator":"0985","public_flags":0},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"mentions":[{"id":"219809145195331584","username":"KarlT99","avatar":"d351679843457f14e7537e5b2ab6ade2","avatar_decoration":null,"discriminator":"6210","public_flags":0}],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"timestamp":"2022-08-18T01:24:18.930000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[],"message_reference":{"channel_id":"877612915333681233","guild_id":"514967871823020053","message_id":"1009408520749326388"},"referenced_message":{"id":"1009408520749326388","type":0,"content":"How fast (in WPM(Words Per Minute)) should i talk while doing standup?

someone dealing with your case, I'd recommend visiting stand up plays, open mics and also working on improvisation.  Get in a your school's theater club as high school plays are mostly comedies based on the student's improvisation and also write down things that u encounter on daily and find funny. After writing them down, shorten it out, remove unneeded parts and fill it with punchlines and phrases that will catch the audience's attention.

If you can be yourself on stage nobody else can be you and you have the law of supply and demand covered.\n\n2. The act is something you fall back on if you can’t think of anything else to say.\n\n3. Only do what you think is funny, never just what you think they will like, even though it’s not that funny to you.\n\n4. Never ask them is this funny – you tell them this is funny.\n\n5. You are not married to any of this shit – if something happens, taking you off on a tangent, NEVER go back and finish a bit, just move on.\n\n6. NEVER ask the audience “How You Doing?” People who do that can’t think of an opening line. They came to see you to tell them how they’re doing, asking that stupid question up front just digs a hole. This is The Most Common Mistake made by performers. I want to leave as soon as they say that.\n\n7. Write what entertains you. If you can’t be funny be interesting. You haven’t lost the crowd. Have something to say and then do it in a funny way.\n\n8. I close my eyes and walk out there and that’s where I start, Honest.\n\n9. Listen to what you are saying, ask yourself, “Why am I saying it and is it Necessary?” (This will filter all your material and cut the unnecessary words, economy of words)\n\n10. Play to the top of the intelligence of the room. There aren’t any bad crowds, just wrong choices.\n\n11. Remember this is the hardest thing there is to do. If you can do this you can do anything.\n\n12. I love my cracker roots.
